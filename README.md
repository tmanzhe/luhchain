idk how bitcoin went from 15k to 140k in like 2 years. 

thats why im making luhchain that will soon include luhcoin lol

its going to break btc 

this project is coded in java and the main objective is to get introduced to making a simple blockchain. 

at this current stage, my blockchain is consisted of blocks w data, has digital signatures that chains the blocks tgt, and has a method to validate it (req proof of work mining) 
as for the future of this project, i hope to include tansactions, signatures and wallets.
